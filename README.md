# Project-World-Abyss
Welcome to the abyss of the world, where you can learn about continents, countries and cities. 

World_Abyss is a **conceptual** desktop application made through experimentation just to showcase the power of PyQt5 and/or Pyside2 to design user interfaces, as such it is not completely feature-packed. People often say GUI is not a strength of Python, but here they will be proven wrong. PyQt is an excellent way to bring python into the realm of graphical interfaces, albeit among the sea of other frameworks such as Tkinter and wxpython. All elements are built from the ground up using tools and widgets. 

I designed World_Abyss with inspirational cues from the modern flat industrial design as featured in macOS Big Sur. As such, this desktop application is implemented through Apple's Mac system, but it is compatible with Windows and Linux because it is cross-platform. 

Instructions to execute the application is shown in the requirements.txt document. 

**To run this python desktop application, drop me an email as referenced from my profile to request for me to sendover an additional image directory as well as a configuration py file. These 2 items are necessary for the application to execute properly.***
